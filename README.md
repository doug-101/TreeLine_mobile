# TreeLine_mobile

This is a simple viewer for TreeLine files for Android devices.  It is written
in Flutter, so it should be eay to create an IOS version, but I have no devices
for testing.

It is only a viewer - no editing is possible.

This supports most TreeLine formatting and field types, but it does have some
limitations.  Internal links will not function.  Formatting using sibling
pre/suffixes, such as internal bullets and tables, have not been implemented.

## Installation

An apk file is provided that can be downloaded to an Android device and run.
This app is not yet in any app stores.

## Usage

Tap the File Browse button to open a TRLN file.  Tap on nodes to expand or
collase them.  A long touch on a node shows a screen with detailed output for
that node and its children.
